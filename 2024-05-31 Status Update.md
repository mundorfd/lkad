# 2024-05-31 Status Update

## Course Development Projects

### S24

#### AEC 250

- Updates to every homework PDF. The graduate student who created the original files introduced most errors, and Penny finally had a second graduate student review them. 
- Added rubric to all discussions
- Penny delivered the exams for me to build and a practice Gradescope activity. I need to help migrate the course to the live site, hook up Gradescope, and write up instructor documentation for the course, particularly Gradescope.
- She is working on the Syllabus.
- The CoreEd approval has not been received yet. It is being taught this summer with the BACC Core outcomes. I updated all the Overview pages.
- I have asked that all work (mine and theirs) be completed before our next meeting, Friday, June 7.

#### SOC 280

- Met with Lori about issues experienced with the custom Geocaching tool, making it difficult for her to associate student entries with individual students and grade the activity. Some students also had uploaded non-supported image files that didn't render. There was no indication that the image format was not supported or a way for students to see that it hadn't worked. The media team turned around enhancements/fixes for the high-priority items almost immediately!

### U24

#### CS 290

- Nauman is about 90% done with the videos. But a few videos remain for some explorations in Modules 8 & 9. Since he is already past his extended due date, he will complete the remaining videos as DIY.
- I completed modules 1–3 in his site
- Began updates to code blocks for syntax highlighting
- embedded available media
- Our goal is to finish this course next week. Nauman will be on vacation.

#### CS 332

- no progress on this project this past week.

#### CS 372

- Built [Practice Exercises: Subnet Addressing: CS 372 - Development Site (U24)](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1981343/pages/practice-exercises-subnet-addressing), 9 H5P activities
- Built [Practice Exercises: NAT: CS 372 - Development Site (U24)](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1981343/pages/practice-exercises-nat?module_item_id=24450419), 9 more H5P activities

#### MAST 201

- Lori has delivered weeks 1–3, and begun work on a staged assignment
- I setup site, build start here overview

#### NMC 333

### F24

#### CE 382

- I have no content yet, meeting with them this week.

#### CEM 341

- Worked on CC images for slide decks, reviewed for one deck, and helped Haley flush out her student worker request, based on Melanie pushback: https://app.asana.com/0/1207060579067153/1207404365051052. Students can save us a lot of time here with reverse image searches and looking for CC replacements. At least take a first pass.

#### CS 161

- Completed my review and update of modules 6, 8 and started on 9
- Tim has DIY recordings, rubrics and quiz bank updates remaining. Module content is largely in place.
