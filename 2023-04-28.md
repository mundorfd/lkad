- Penelope is not participating in the DOC, nor has she responded to my last two emails. She stopped communicating after telling me that the 4 credit approval was delayed, and that she didn't want to develop for 3 just to have to rework it next year. I offered a few options, that she seemed interested in at first: 
	- build for 4 credits and delay offering until approved
	- build for 4 credits modularly, so that the additional credit content could be added at a later date

- I did research for Tim on Specification grading and AI Detection and prevention. Shared my results. He has decided that rather than use tokens, he is leaning toward allowing students to submit a revision for each assignment. The main reason for the tokens is to save time on grading, but with a limited enrollment course, he thinks it should be manageable, and didn't want to artificially limit their revisions.
