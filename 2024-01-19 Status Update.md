# 2024-01-19 Status Update

I will update this with content from the week of 1/15 as well, between holidays, campus closure and, no internet service, it will be a short week.

## Course Development Projects

### W24

#### AEC 250

* Built Learning Materials Template for all modules and populated.
* Embedded Media for Module 1
* Discussed Accessibility of slides with Penny
* Built all Overview Pages
* Made suggestions to update some of the Module Learning Outcomes with measurability issues.
* Penny has completed all lecture slides and recordings. Waiting on one more homework solutions video from her graduate students, which is scheduled for Friday, January 19, 2024. Some remaining work to embed slides (create a version without her animations and dozens of alt text image descriptions, I am helping by providing her the alt text generated by ChatGPT as a starting point.
* In addition, I am still waiting for the following from Penny:
	* midterm and final exams
	* 50% of the weekly readings
	* weekly discussion prompts and evaluation criteria for discussions

#### CH 332

There has been lots of back and forth with Jeff over the module content and naming on all the components. We meet 2024-01-11 and I believe now have a clear picture of each unit. Not going to let him rename things again! He has changed versions of the textbook. The old chapters and sections were used to name each lecture, the reading assignments, the suggested textbook problems, weekly worksheets, quiz questions and quizzes, unit assessments and module titles. We thought we had it figured in the last meeting, but he disagreed and shared a (new?) naming scheme for each of these components.

Each module contains:

1. Overview Page
2. An embedded "Study Guide" which is a checklist of all the student's tasks. Textbook readings, textbook suggested problems, a list of videos to watch. These are in Qualtrics and embedded as a PDF. Fortunately updating content on Qualtrics does not require re-embedding of surveys. The PDFs need to be modified and made accessible.
3. One to two Learning Materials Pages each with a list of readings, links to lectures and embedded lectures.
4. Weekly Homework
5. Weekly Quiz
6. Every other week there is a Unit Assessment with an accompanying study guide.

* Jeff updated how he wants the following done after they were built, so will need some reworking
	* built all Learning Materials pages with updated chapter readings
	* built remaining 9 Qualtrics surveys, overview pages
* Built Discussions
* Updated Unit Titles with Chapter Readings
* Updated the video embed titles in surveys and on learning materials
* Rebuilt my parts through Module 3 (PDF study guides, Learning Materials, and Qualtrics Surveys)

#### CS 492

* A few lingering accessibility updates

### S24

#### BDS 599

* Sent Reminder of Upcoming Deadlines for Spring 2024 Course Development and requested meeting.
* One of the hangups for students in this course is setting up their access to remote high capacity computers needed for the data processing. I took the existing instructions and reworked them, chunking content, simplifying instructions and highlighting the trouble spots
* Developed overview of MasteryPaths document to share with Andrew

#### CS 201

* Check in meeting with Brian Baker. He has not made progress. I shared the suggested milestones, and reviewed the module template with him.

#### SOC 280

* no activity this week, check in scheduled for Thursday, January 18, 2024.

#### CS 499 (CS 435)

* Reached out with reminder of upcoming deadlines and requested status update. (Amy wants to meet as rarely as possible.) She responded quickly:

	> My development was put on hold for a short time per some questions that the AI Curriculum Committee wanted to first address.Â 
	> As such, my teaching load was adjusted and I plan to meet with the AI CC on Jan 17th.Â 
	> From there, I hope to be able to move the project forward.Â 
	> Once I meet with them and then hear more from their team, from Ben Lee, and from Justin, I will email.

#### NSE 515

* follow up with Camille with questions on a quiz
* Shared 3 timelines with her and how to use them, she tested

### U24

* no activity this week, check in scheduled for Thursday, January 18, 2024.

#### MAST 201

#### MB 302

* Can't find the official CLOs, she wasn't sure either. Lots of instructors have worked on this, she's worried they may have been modified, working on copy in a syllabus. Not sure if all the courses (5 in person and online) are using the same CLOs. Concerned about drift
* held intake with Linda, she classified this as a major redevelopment
	* outlined media plan which includes an h5P site, a jeopardy style game and narrated lectures

#### NMC 3xx

* Intake with Alina
* She does not yet have learning outcomes. The proposal is pending, she anticipates acceptance by the end of Winter term.
