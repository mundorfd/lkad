## Course Development Projects

### S23

#### CCE 321

- No activity this week from me. Burkan sent me a note Wednesday that he is finishing up his recordings and hopes to go over all his weeks when we next meet. 

#### ENSC 517

#### NMC 280

- Outlined remaining tasks for Alina
- Created a generic discussion rubric and attached to all her weekly discussions
- Rebuilt NMC 280 Syllabus, required content was not in place and was using an outdated template. 

#### PSY 311

- Final course checks, accessibility and links. 
- Filled out Ecampus Essentials

#### SOC 481

- all done but media embeds and final checks

#### SUS 304

- Two hour working meeting with Ann. Her characterization of the Weekly learning outcomes, the CLOs they were helping realized and the associated tasks were characterized in numerous different ways, inconsistently present and with different numbering schemes. 
	- Before meeting with her I put the outcomes (BACC Core, CLOs, WLOS) and the associated Materials/Activities/Assessments in an [Relational Database using Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrtm0WxOXDfJtPHO) to help visualize the issue and help her ensure everything was covered.
	- I then put all the CLOs on every Overview page, and we wen through them one by one, to indicate which ones were covered in the week and delete the others. We then updated the WLOs as needed and indicated their associated CLOs. Then, we indicated the related MLOs with each activity on the task list.
	- By the end of the week, I was able to share a spreadsheet built from the [Airtable Database](https://airtable.com/shrtm0WxOXDfJtPHO) with her.
- Completed course build. Ann finished giving me content on _Friday_, and a large percentage came in this last week. Honestly was quite a grind to get her done, that involved working late several nights and much of Saturday.
- Ran all final checks, accessibility, links, etc. She had a few pending PDFs that needed to be fixed for accessibility, but everything else passed when I was done. (I have a student request on the PDFs and will replace them when they are returned.)
- Filled out Ecampus Essentials
