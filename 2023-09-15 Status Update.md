### Course Development Projects

#### CS Template

I have copied the Ecampus_CS_Template and made some adjustments in [2023 Updated CS Template](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1963837). Shared updates with CS ID team and Melanie. Melanie wanted to use this as the new template.

##### Updates

- Dana, Melanie, Laurie, Phil and myself are all leaders.
- Removed several dozen empty `<span>` tags that don't contain any CSS
- Academic Integrity at OSU: Ecampus_CS_Template page had a n `<h6>` for emphasis around a quote. This caused an accessibility issue, since heading levels were skipped. I have it converted to a blockquote.
- Updated embed code for Academic Integrity at OSU: Ecampus_CS_Template that was in a studio site we didn't have access to.
- Removed typo every Overview page
- Fixed Module 1 Overview banner is marked as decorative, while all the others have alt="overview".
- Start Here - Where to go for help - made this in title case like the rest of the Start Here pages.
- On Overview pages of the CS template, Heading 2 for "Explorations" has different styling than the others.
